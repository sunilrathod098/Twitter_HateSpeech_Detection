# Hate Speech Detection on Twitter


Author - @sunilrathod098  (Danavath Sunil Rathod)

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect hate speech on Twitter using Python. The goal is to develop a model that can identify and classify tweets containing hate speech or offensive language. The project utilizes various machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods to achieve accurate detection and classification.


## Key Features

- *Data Collection*: Tweets are collected from Twitter using the Twitter API.
- *Data Preprocessing*: Tweets are cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- *Feature Extraction*: Textual features are extracted using techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.
- *Model Training*: Various machine learning models are trained to detect hate speech, including logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks.
- *Evaluation*: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- *Deployment*: The trained model can be deployed for real-time hate speech detection on new tweets.
Project Structure


The project is organized into the following sections:

- *Data Collection*: Scripts and notebooks for collecting and storing tweets from Twitter.
- *Data Preprocessing*: Code for cleaning and preprocessing the collected tweet data.
- *Feature Extraction*: Implementation of feature extraction methods to prepare the data for model training.
- *Model Training*: Code for training various machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
- *Evaluation*: Scripts for evaluating the performance of the models and generating metrics.
- *Deployment*: Instructions and code for deploying the trained model for real-time use.
